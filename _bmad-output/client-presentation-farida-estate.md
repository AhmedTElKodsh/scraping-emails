## 9. Financial Projections

### Market Size Estimation

**Conservative Estimate:**

- 222 properties × 20 shares × 50 EGP/share = 222,000 EGP total market
- Assuming 30% fill rate = 66,600 EGP active investments
- Platform fee (estimated 2-5%) = 1,332 - 3,330 EGP revenue potential

**Growth Scenario:**

- If market expands to 500 properties = 500,000 EGP market capacity
- At 50% fill rate = 250,000 EGP active investments
- Platform revenue potential = 5,000 - 12,500 EGP
